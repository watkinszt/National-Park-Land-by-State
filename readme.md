# National Park Land by State – Choropleth Map

## Project Overview

This interactive choropleth map visualizes the distribution of National Park Service (NPS) land across the United States, highlighting the vast expanse of protected areas in each state. 

## Data Source

The dataset is derived from the article:

> "Mapped: The States With the Most and Least National Park Land"  
> by Tim Brinkhof, Mental Floss, August 30, 2025  
> [https://www.mentalfloss.com/geography/maps/states-with-most-national-park-land](https://www.mentalfloss.com/geography/maps/states-with-most-national-park-land)

The data includes the total acres of NPS-managed land in each state, with Alaska leading by managing over half of all NPS lands.

## Map Features

- **Interactive Choropleth**: Hover over each state to view the exact acreage of NPS-managed land.
- **Color Gradient**: A blue color scale represents the range of acreage, with darker shades indicating larger areas.
- **Responsive Design**: The map adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Legend**: A dynamic legend provides context to the color scale.
